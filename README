Bitoin SoK paper
--


What's an SoK paper?

- Basically a survey paper, but necessarily more. See {} Oakland's SoK
  criteria. Essentially it should also have a novel perspective.


Our paper will be the first to systematically explore the design space
of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Our paper has several contributions.
- We will provide a comprehensive explanation of the Bitcoin protocol
and ecosystem, targeting computer science researchers (as opposed to
policy, economists, or end users). There is currently no truly great
overview of Bitcoin that researchers can cite and point to, and as a
result every paper has to describe Bitcoin from scratch.

- We will provide novel abstractions/generalizations as a basis for
understanding and evaluating the complexity not just Bitcoin, but also
the significantly different related systems such as Mastercoin,
Ethereum, Ripple, etc.

- We will provide a categorization and comparison of all the
proposed Bitcoin extensions and alternatives, both from the academic
community and the developer community. There are a ton of great ideas
buried in the Bitcoin dev forums and mailing lists, where it's hard
for researchers to find them.
